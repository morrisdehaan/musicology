# Corpus Description
This period I would like to investigate how song lyrics correlate with music properties such as modality, energy levels and dynamic pitch range across different genres. More specifically, the research focuses on relating the words contained by the lyrics to musical properties. I find it highly interesting to see how the mood and emotionality of a song/genre affect a sing and songwriter when writing the lyrics. I expect some obvious results, such that hip hop is generally more about the ‘hood’ than rock music, and perhaps that songs in a minor mode deal with sad topics more frequently than major mode songs. 

 

Because the lyrical vocabulaire is extremely rich, a large, diverse dataset is of the essence. To accomplish this and to keep the corpus representative, I will put together a corpus that draws inspiration from a broad range of genres. This includes mainstream genres such as pop music, but also more obscure ones such as industrial hip hop, as unexpected yet interesting patterns may emerge. I will dissect the word usage for each genre and then compare word usages of different genres. It would be interesting to know if genres with similar lyrics have similar properties.

 

A list of albums per genre that make up the corpus (for now):

Pop: 

Midnights (Taylor Swift); WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (Billie Eilish); Dua Lipa (Dua Lipa)

 

Hip Hop:

Madvillainy (MF DOOM, Madlib); ASTROWORLD (Travis Scott); HEROES & VILLAINS (Metro Boomin)
