### Introduction

This period I would like to investigate how song lyrics correlate with music properties such as modality, energy levels and dynamic pitch range across different genres. More specifically, the research focuses on relating the words contained by the lyrics to musical properties. I find it highly interesting to see how the mood and emotionality of a song/genre affect a sing and songwriter when writing the lyrics. I expect some obvious results, such that hip hop is generally more about the ‘hood’ than rock music, and perhaps that songs in a minor mode deal with sad topics more frequently than major mode songs. 

 

Because the lyrical vocabulaire is extremely rich, a large, diverse dataset is of the essence. To accomplish this and to keep the corpus representative, I will put together a corpus that draws inspiration from a broad range of genres. This includes mainstream genres such as pop music, but also more obscure ones such as industrial hip hop, as unexpected yet interesting patterns may emerge. I will dissect the word usage for each genre and then compare word usages of different genres. It would be interesting to know if genres with similar lyrics have similar properties.

 

A list of albums per genre that make up the corpus (for now):

*Pop*: 
Midnights (Taylor Swift); WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? (Billie Eilish); Dua Lipa (Dua Lipa)
 
*Hip Hop*:
Madvillainy (MF DOOM, Madlib); ASTROWORLD (Travis Scott); HEROES & VILLAINS (Metro Boomin)

*Alternative Rock*:
Elephant (The White Stripes); ..Like Clockwork (Queens of the Stone Age); Street Worms (Viagra Boys)

*Industrial hip hop*:
The Money Store (Death Grips); OFFLINE! (JPEGMAFIA); Visions of Bodies Being Burned (clipping.)

*Classical (translated to english)*:
Wilhelmus (Marnix Van St. Aldegonde), Negende symfonie (Beethoven)


### Analysis of an odd one out
```{r, include=FALSE}

sna_analysis <- get_tidy_audio_analysis("3dPQuX8Gs42Y7b454ybpMR")

sna_bar <- sna_analysis %>%
  compmus_align(bars, segments) %>%
  select(bars) %>%
  unnest(bars) %>%
  mutate(pitches=map(segments, compmus_summarise, pitches,
        method="rms", norm="euclidean"
  )) %>%
  mutate(timbre=map(segments, compmus_summarise, timbre,
        method="rms", norm="euclidean"
  ))

sna_beat <- sna_analysis %>%
  compmus_align(beats, segments) %>%
  select(beats) %>%
  unnest(beats) %>%
  mutate(pitches=map(segments, compmus_summarise, pitches,
        method="rms", norm="euclidean"
  )) %>%
  mutate(timbre=map(segments, compmus_summarise, timbre,
        method="rms", norm="euclidean"
  ))

```

```{r}
sna_beat %>%
  compmus_gather_timbre() |>
  ggplot(aes(
      start + duration/2, basis,
      width=duration,
      fill=value
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x="time (s)", y=NULL, fill="magnitude") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +                              
  theme_minimal()
```

***
In order for us to broaden our understanding of the entire dataset, it can
be useful zoom in and investigate a single track. Let us investigate not
any song, but one of the most iconic out of the entire dataset: Seven Nation
Army.
To the side, you will find a cepstrogram, with a level of detail per beat. As 
you can see, the timbre varies between two of the timbre properties. After
listening to the song this makes sense: the electric guitar amplifier
settings change between the chorus and verse. Though, the image is a bit
noisy, so let's investigate a more granular time division.

### Analysis of an odd one out, a bit less specific

```{r}
sna_bar %>%
  compmus_gather_timbre() |>
  ggplot(aes(
      start + duration/2, basis,
      width=duration,
      fill=value
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x="time (s)", y=NULL, fill="magnitude") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +                              
  theme_minimal()
```

***
Now the time division is per bar. This gives a clearer image and it
emphasizes our conclusion.

### Song structure analysis

```{r}
sna_bar %>%
  compmus_self_similarity(timbre, "cosine") %>%
  ggplot(aes(
      xstart + xduration/2,
      ystart + yduration/2,
      width=xduration,
      height=yduration,
      fill=d
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(guide="none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="", y="")
```

***
Let us try to delve deeper into our hypothesis that the different
timbres are caused by differences in chorus and verse.
To accomplish this, we will generate a self-similarity
matrix for timbre and pitch.
Here you see the self-similarity matrix of seven nation army for timbre.
Our conclusion is made even stronger, it seems the timbre is split into
a two parts, possibly.

### Song structure analysis

```{r}
sna_bar %>%
  compmus_self_similarity(pitches, "cosine") %>%
  ggplot(aes(
      xstart + xduration/2,
      ystart + yduration/2,
      width=xduration,
      height=yduration,
      fill=d
  )) +
  geom_tile() +
  coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(guide="none") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x="", y="")
```

***
To be certain here I present the pitch self-similarity matrix also.
This also strongens our evidence that the song is split into two parts,
we can now say this with full certainty.
The blocky pattern can be explained by the chord changes.

### Comparison of tracks within an album

```{r}
# plot
ggplot(alb_elephant_feats, aes(track.short_name, energy, fill="red")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title="Energy levels for tracks on 'Elephant' by The White Stripes") +
  geom_col()
```

***

Before we shall discover inter-album relations, let us commit to a single album,
such that we can shape an idea what the variation within an album might look 
like.


### Comparison of different albums

```{r}
ggplot(all_albs, aes(tempo, energy, col=track.album.name, size=track.popularity)) +
  labs(title="Energy vs. Tempo") +
  geom_point()
```

***

### Self-similarity

Intuitively, tempo and energy are correlating factors of a song. We imagine
high energy songs generally have a fast tempo. Let us investigate this
thought by plotting the data for number of albums. As you can see, some
albums tend to be limited in their energy range, whilst others are
more or less contained.

### Conclusion

What is there not to say. We live in a data driven society that harbors
as many music tastes as there are colors in a van Gogh painting. But just
like a van Gogh painting, you can dissect it and scrutinize the most 
elementary aspects, from its radiance to its perspective on the cruelties and
absurdities of society. We looked at energy levels, at tempo, a variety
of tracks and albums, from a point of view of strict objectiveness, one
that our primordial ancestors would not even be able to fathom. One could
draw an infinite number of conclusions, some might jump out more than others.
What is a data driven society without conclusions?
